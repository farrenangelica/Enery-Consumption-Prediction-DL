## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify missing values and data inconsistencies.  
- Encoded categorical features (e.g., *HVACUsage*, *LightingUsage*, *Holiday*) and scaled numerical values using **StandardScaler**.  
- Split data into training, validation, and test sets with a **70:10:20** ratio.

### 2. Model Development
Developed and compared four ANN models:
- **Baseline Sequential Model**  
- **Baseline Functional Model**  
- **Modified Sequential Model** (Leaky ReLU, Batch Normalization, Dropout)  
- **Modified Functional Model** (enhanced architecture with activation tuning)

### 3. Training
- All models trained for a minimum of **10 epochs** using the **Adam optimizer**.  
- Implemented **early stopping** and **learning rate tuning** for model stability.

## üìà Model Evaluation

Models were evaluated using three key regression metrics:

| Model | MSE | MAE | R¬≤ | Summary |
|--------|------|------|------|----------|
| **Baseline Sequential** | 61.86 | 6.25 | 0.175 | High error, limited variance explanation |
| **Baseline Functional** | 62.45 | 6.27 | 0.168 | Similar to baseline Sequential |
| **Modified Sequential** | 57.57 | 5.99 | 0.233 | Best performance, reduced error and improved fit |
| **Modified Functional** | 57.59 | 5.96 | 0.232 | Comparable to Modified Sequential |

### üîç Insights
- Incorporating **Leaky ReLU**, **Batch Normalization**, and **Dropout** layers improved model performance significantly.  
- The **Modified Sequential Model** achieved the **lowest MSE (57.57)** and **highest R¬≤ (0.233)**, making it the best-performing model.
